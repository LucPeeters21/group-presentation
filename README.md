## Presentation Topic
Bol.com’s Seller Experience team is looking to expand the number of third party vendors who sell on the site. One problem they are facing is that new vendors have less, and noisier reviews by consumers about their reputation. Propose a new strategy that they could adopt to help new seller’s reputations on Bol.com and an analytical framework that you could use to test whether this strategy is successful.
